Create a <code>creds.py</code> file that looks like the following:
```
username = "put_username_here"
password = "put_password_here"
```
As of now, <code>main.py</code> can log the distribution of classifications (will move to actual log file when the html file creation works). There are a few bugs with the original python client that have to be fixed (used sketchy workarounds to make it work currently).
